# 0x02. Minimum Operations

## Description
This project involves solving the "Minimum Operations" problem using Python. The problem entails finding the minimum number of operations required to get from a string containing only the character 'H' to a target string of a certain length by only performing two operations: copying all the characters in the current string, or pasting the characters from the current string.
